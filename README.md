# TMS9900-99000-Assembler
An Assembler for the TMS9900/90000 CPUs

This is a assembler for the TMS9900/90000 processor that produces non relocatable (absolute) code for .A99 assembler code.   The relocatable assembler is based on this assembler.   A test programme located in the Tests folder provide an example of a TMS 9900 Monitor (TIMON) source code, TIMON-V2.A99 and HEX (TIMON-V2.H99) and Listing file (TIMON-V2.L99).  Eclipse project files are also included.
