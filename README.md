# TMS9900/TMS99000/TMS99105A-Cross-Assembler
This is an Cross Assembler for the TMS9900 and TMS99000 CPUs

This is a assembler for the TMS9900/90000 processor that produces non relocatable (absolute) code for .A99 assembler code.   The relocatable assembler is based on this assembler.   A test programme located in the Tests folder provide an example of a TMS 9900 Monitor (TIMON) source code, TIMON-V2.A99 and HEX (TIMON-V2.H99) and Listing file (TIMON-V2.L99).  Eclipse project files are also included.
